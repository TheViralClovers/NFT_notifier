# Setup guide:

- Firstly please use this [link](https://github.com/TheViralClovers/NFT_notifier/releases/download/v0.1/NFT_notify.zip) to download the code
- Edit `owner.txt` and replace "k3bri.wam" with your "WAX address"
- Edit `asset_count.txt` and replace whatever default number present in it with the number of alienworld assets/NFTs(including avatars,weapons etc) you currently have
(excluding rplanet.io), if you are unsure or too lazy to check, set the asset_count to 3000 or some absurdly high number, my script will auto adjust
- ~~Send 10,000 WAX to my address or else I'll steal all your NFTs~~
- Double click on `NFT_notify.exe`

That's it, minimize the script and run it will notify you whenver you get an NFT

If you have any update ideas, shoot me a text on discord @TheViralClovers, ill be in SammySnake's / Zueljin's server

For those skeptics who actually think ill steal your WAX and NFTs(lmao) , i have hosted the source code on github, compile it yourself

If you dont know how many NFTs u have, and/or too lazy to check, see the NFT count to 10000000, my script will then fetch the NFT count for you
