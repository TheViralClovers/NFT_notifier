hey, i suck at formatting things, so here goes

How to use this thing:

Firstly please use this link to download : https://github.com/TheViralClovers/NFT_notifier/releases/download/v0.1/NFT_notify.zip

1) edit owner.txt and replace k3bri.wam with your WAX address
2) edit asset_count.txt and replace whatever default number present in it with the number of alienworld assets/NFTs(including avatars,weapons etc)  you currently have
(excluding rplanet.io) ,if you are unsure or too lazy to check, set the asset_count to 3000 or some absurdly high number, my script will auto adjust
3) S̶e̶n̶d̶ ̶1̶0̶,̶0̶0̶0̶ ̶W̶A̶X̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶r̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶e̶l̶s̶e̶ ̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶N̶F̶T̶s̶
4) Double click on NFT_notify.exe

That's it, minimize the script and run it will notify you whenver you get an NFT

For those skeptics who actually think ill steal your WAX and NFTs(lmao) , i have hosted the source code on github, compile it yourself

If you dont know how many NFTs u have, and/or too lazy to check, se the NFT count to 10000000, my script will then fetch the NFT count for you
